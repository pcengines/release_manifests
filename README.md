Release manifests for PCEngines firmware bundles
================================================

This repository contains manifests for repo tool used for tracking the
releases of mainline (4.6.x) and legacy (4.0.x) versions of firmware bundle.

There are two branches:
* `coreboot-4.0.x` - for legacy releases
* `coreboot-4.6.x` - for mainline releases

## Use repo tool to initialize set of repositories

```
mkdir apu2_fw_rel
cd apu2_fw_rel

repo init -u git@github.com:pcengines/release_manifests.git -b refs/tags/<tag_release>
# or
repo init -u git@github.com:pcengines/release_manifests.git -b <branch_name>

repo sync --force-sync
```

where:
* `<tag_release>` - is the release version number (e.g. `v4.5.3.1`)
* `<branch_name>` - is the release branch (i.e. `coreboot-4.0.x` for legacy,
and `coreboot-4.6.x` for mainline

## Build container

This is to avoid impact of system on build results:

```
docker build -t pcengines/apu2 apu2/apu2-documentation
```

This step could be omitted, if there was build done before (container already
exists).

## Build release

Assuming you initialized the repo with *mainline* release:

```
./apu2/apu2-documentation/scripts/apu2_fw_rel.sh build-ml menuconfig
```

Please choose:

```
Mainboard -> Mainboard vendor -> PC Engines
Mainboard -> Mainboard model  -> APU2
#or
Mainboard -> Mainboard model  -> APU3
```

All other pieces will be set according to recent release configuration.
*coreboot* image will start to build after exiting menu.

For *legacy* release you can use this command. You don't need to run
`menuconfig` first, because *legacy* release get's initialized by custom
`.config` file:
```
./apu2/apu2-documentation/scripts/apu2_fw_rel.sh build
```

There are also additional commands like:
```
# distclean && menuconfig
./apu2/apu2-documentation/scripts/apu2_fw_rel.sh build-ml distclean

#rm -rf .config* && menuconfig
./apu2/apu2-documentation/scripts/apu2_fw_rel.sh build-ml cfgclean

#custom make parameters
./apu2/apu2-documentation/scripts/apu2_fw_rel.sh build-ml custom <param>
```

After successful build, you can flash target device.

## Flash release

Note that below script assume that you have ssh enabled connection with target
device and destination OS [APU2 image builder](https://github.com/pcengines/apu2-documentation#building-firmware-using-apu2-image-builder)
or other distro that have working `flashrom` available in `PATH`. Without keys
added you will see question about password couple times during flashing.

```
./apu2/apu2-documentation/scripts/apu2_fw_rel.sh flash <user>@<ip_address>
```

For mainline:

```
./apu2/apu2-documentation/scripts/apu2_fw_rel.sh flash-ml <user>@<ip_address>
```

Best way is to use `root` as `<user>` because it can have no problem with low
level access.

Please do not hesitate with providing feedback or contributing fixes.

## Known issues

### using repo with coreboot show errors like:

```
fatal: Not a git repository (or any parent up to mount point /coreboot)
Stopping at filesystem boundary (GIT_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM not set).
```

Since it use `git` commands to create build timestamp.

#### flashing doesn't work
